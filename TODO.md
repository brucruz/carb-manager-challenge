## What needs to be done to complete this challenge

### UI

[x] Translate the design as closely as possible to custom CSS. We've also provided hover styles for you to replicate.
[x] Use SVG-s for the custom icons. These can be grabbed from the Figma file.
[x] Make sure the Recipe title gets truncated after 2 lines
[x] The star ratings should be able to work with half-stars.
[x] If a recipe duration is longer than 60 minutes, the format should be x hr x min
[x] Make sure that energy information is displayed based on user settings (either as calories or kJ)

### Interactions

[x] The whole card will be clickable. Make sure that the event is working properly.
[] Because the whole card is clickable, the "heart" icon in the top right won't be interactive. Instead, it should be empty or filled in depending on a certain prop value.
